# COIS-2240: Assignment #1

This assignment requires us to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given `n` value. We must do so both iteratively and recursively.

For example, running the function with a parameter of `n = 10` will return
```
>>> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

We must run the program with `n` values from `10` to `50`, in `n = 10` intervals. We must log how long each of these calls take and create a graph of them. The assignment also includes using Git + Github for version control during the process of development. 

Finally (technically, this was supposed to come first, but oh well), there is a small word-to-UML-Diagram problem to do.
